This is the Kendra.io CORS proxy. It allows the http://app.kendra.io to interact with external systems. 


Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.

Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results
in the addition of a X-CORS-Redirect-n header, where n starts at 1. These headers are not
accessible by the XMLHttpRequest API.
After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back
to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect (handled automatically by the browser).


The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header.
The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.
